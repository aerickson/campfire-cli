campfire-cli is a simple command line interface to 37signals campfire product. 

== Requirements ==


== Usage ==

Define the campfire accounts and chat rooms you want to use in ~/.campfire.yml file. It is a simple yml file, mine looks like this:


underlog:
   domain: underlg
   username: underlog(at)gmail
   password: passs
   default-room: Room 1

underlog-room2:
   domain: underlg
   username: underlog(at)gmail
   password: passs
   default-room: Room 2
   # ssl: true #uncomment this if you use paid accounts

#vim: filetype=yaml


The default-room is optional, and if missed, you will be presented by a list of options.

== TODO ==
Many stuff ;)
